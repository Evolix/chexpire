Hi,

We had recurrent failures while checking the whois database for domain
<%= @check.domain %>. As of today, we can't anymore verify the expiry date.

The last known expiry date is <%= format_utc(@check.domain_expires_at) %>.
The last successful check occured <%= format_utc(@check.last_success_at) %>.

If you have deleted your domain or have not renewed it, please disable
or delete the check by following this link:

<%= edit_check_url(@check) %>

<%= render "check_comment_vendor" %>

<%= render "footer_recurrent_failures", delay: @notification.delay, check: @check %>
